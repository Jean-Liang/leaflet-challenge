# leaflet-challenge
This challenge is to create the Earthquake Visualisation through the USGS GeoJSON Feed website (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php).
- Background of USGS:
The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change.
Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

- Leaflet-Part-1:
Data set choose from Feeds section- Past Day- All Earthquakes
Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from this dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

The script can be found in static folder- js folder -logic.js file

Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by colour. 
Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in colour.

Map is displayed as below:
It can be viewed from github page through the link: https://jean-liang.github.io/leaflet-challenge/
